To address the coaching staff's requirement of accessing and acquiring the output themselves within a one-week timeframe, I propose the following solution:

We will develop a web-based dashboard that offers a user-friendly interface for the coaching staff. They can input their queries and easily retrieve the desired output without needing extensive technical knowledge. The dashboard will be intuitive and designed to minimize any learning curve.

To handle the data processing and analysis, we will utilize a backend system built on Python, leveraging the existing codebase we have developed. This system will efficiently process the data based on the queries received from the dashboard.

To connect the web-based dashboard with the backend processing system, we will create an API. This API will act as a bridge, receiving query parameters from the dashboard, invoking the appropriate methods from the ProcessGameState class to process the data, and returning the results seamlessly to the dashboard.

To enhance the dashboard's usability, we will incorporate data visualization components. These visualizations, such as charts, heatmaps, and other relevant graphics, will present the results in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand manner. This way, the coaching staff can grasp the insights quickly and make informed decisions.

To ensure security and restricted access, we will implement authentication mechanisms. Only authorized coaching staff will be able to access the dashboard and retrieve the results. Additionally, we will implement robust security measures to protect the data and prevent unauthorized access, ensuring confidentiality.

For deployment, we will host the web-based dashboard and backend system on a reliable platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. These cloud-based infrastructures provide scalability, reliability, and accessibility, allowing the coaching staff to access the solution seamlessly.

By adopting this solution, the coaching staff will have an intuitive web-based interface where they can easily input queries, retrieve desired outputs, and visualize the data without requiring any coding expertise. This approach not only meets the coaching staff's requirements within the one-week timeframe but also offers a secure and user-friendly solution.
